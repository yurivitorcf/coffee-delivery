# Coffee Delivery Project

This project was created as part of a challenge by Rocketseat to challenge our skills and knowledge. We were provided with a Figma design that serves as a blueprint to help us build a polished and professional application. <br>
The proposed challenge was to solve the application requirements from scratch by following only what was taught before in class and through research to solve problems during development.
